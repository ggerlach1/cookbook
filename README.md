# Cookbook

Since March 2020 I have been cooking a lot and my folder of badly named PDFs
has been getting out of hand. I am creating this mostly for my own personal use
and I plan to add some family recipes. I have now added the Gerlach famous section,
but I would like to add: 
* Gerlach Famous chocolate cake 
* Gerlach Famous Aioli
* Eggplant parmesan
