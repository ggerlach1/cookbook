\ingredients[15]{ \unit[2 1/4]{tsp} & active dry yeast \\ \unit[1 1/4]{cups}
									& warm water \\ \unit[1 1/2]{tsp} &
		molasses \\ \unit[1]{tbsp} & Oil \\ \unit[1 3/4]{cups} & bread flour

\\ }

\preparation{ \newline \step Sprinkle yeast over water and molasses in a
		large mixing bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Add remaining
		ingredients and mix until dough pulls away from the sides of the
		bowl. Turn dough onto a lightly counter and knead for about 10
		minutes, or until you can stretch a small portion of the dough into
		a thin membrane. I was not able to knead enough with an electric
		mixer.  \step place dough in a clean oiled bowl. Cover and allow to
		rise until doubled. Punch down dough, cover and let rise another 15
		minutes. Preheat oven to 350 \faren and lightly oil a loaf pan.
		\step place dough on a lightly floured counter, shape into a loaf
		and place in prepared pan. cover and let rise for about 1 hour or
		until the dough crowns above the pan and gives with a gentle press
		of the fingers, leaving a faint indentation.  \step Bake for 30
		minutes or until golden-brown and hollow sounding when tapped. Cool

		1/4]{tsp} & active dry yeast \\ Pinch & sugar \\ \unit[2]{tbsp} &
Diamond Crystal or 1 tbsp Kosher salt \\ \unit[5]{tbsp} & extra-virgin olive
oil, divided \\ & flaky sea salt \\ & any other toppings\\ }

	\preparation{ \newline \step Combine flour and 2 1/2 cups of
			room-temperature water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
			the dough hook. Mix on low speed unitl a shaggy dough forms.
			Cover and let sit while you prepare the yeast.  \step Stir
			yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup warm water with a fork in a small bowl.
			Let sit until the yeast is foamy.
			\step Pour yeast mixture into stand mixer bowl and mix on low
			speed until dough absorbs all additional water. BE CAREFUL IT
			WILL SPLASH if you don't go slow. Add kosher salt and mix until
			the dough is extremely elastic and very sticky, about 5 minutes
			(the dough will look like a batter).
			\step Pour 3 tbsp oil into a large bowl and swirl to coat sides.
			Scrape in dough cover and place in a warm spot until it has
			doubled in volume.
			\step Drizzle 2 tbsp oil over a 18x 13 sheep pan and rub all
	over bottom and sides. Using a large spatula, fold dough inside bowl a
	couple of times to deflate, then scrape onto prepared baking sheet.
	Using oiled hands, lift up dough and fold over onto itself in half, then
	rotate baking sheet and fold in half again. Cover dough with a piece of
	well-oiled plastic and let rest for 10 minutes to let gluten relax. 
			\step With oiled hands, gently stretch the dough across the baking
			sheet in an even layer. Working all the way to edges and into
			corners. If dough starts to spring back, let sit for 5-10 minutes
			and start again. Cover with oiled plastic and chill at least 8
			hours and up to 24.
			\step Preheat oven to 450 \faren with a rack in the center, let
			dough sit out at room temperature for 45-65 minutes until doubled
			in height.
			\step Remove plastic and drizzle dough generously with more oil.
			Oil hands and press fingertips firmly into dough pushing all the
			way to the bottom of the pan to dimple all over. Sprinkle
			generously with sea salt and any other toppings.
			\step Bake until surface is deep golden brown, 25-35 minutes, let
	cool in pan 10 minutes. Slide a spatula underneath to loosen and transfer
	to a wire rack.  }
